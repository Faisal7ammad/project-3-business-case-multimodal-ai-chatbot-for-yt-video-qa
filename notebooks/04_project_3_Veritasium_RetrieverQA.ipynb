The venom can have various effects on the human body, such as neurotoxicity (affecting the nervous system), hemotoxicity (affecting blood cells), cytotoxicity (attacking cells), and myotoxicity (destroying muscles). Different snakes have evolved different types of venom based on their prey and environment. In the case of a snakebite, it's important to remain calm, immobilize the affected limb, and seek medical help as soon as possible. Antivenom, produced from injecting large animals like horses with diluted venom, is used to counteract the effects of snake venom.

According to this theory, nothing should move through space faster than light.

            "e is a function that repeatedly multiplies by i as you go down the x axis and that is e to the ix It creates a spiral by essentially spreading out these rotations all along the x axis If you look at the real part of this spiral it s a cosine wave And if you look at the imaginary part it s a sine wave The two quintessential functions that describe waves are both contained in e to the ix So when Schr dinger goes to write down a wave equation he naturally assumes that the solutions to his equation will look something like e to the ix specifically e to the ikx minus omega t You might wonder why he would use that formulation and not just a simple sine wave but the exponential has some useful properties If you take the derivative with respect to position or time that derivative is proportional to the original function itself And that s not true if you use the sine function whose derivative is cosine Plus since the Schr dinger equation is linear linear you can add together an arbitrary number of solutions of this form creating any sort of wave shape you like and it too will be a solution to Schr dinger s equation The physicist Freeman Dyson later writes minus 1 into the equation and suddenly it made sense Suddenly it became a wave equation instead of a heat conduction equation And Schr dinger found to his delight that the equation has solutions corresponding to the quantized orbits in the Bohr model of the atom It turns out that the Schr dinger equation describes correctly everything we know about the behavior of atoms It is the basis of all of chemistry and most of physics And that square root of minus one means that Nature works with complex numbers and not with real numbers This discovery came as a complete surprise to Schr dinger as well as to everybody else So imaginary numbers discovered as a The quirky intermediate step on the way to solving the cubic turned out to be fundamental to our description of reality Only by giving up maths connection to reality could it guide us to a deeper truth about the way the universe works Not gonna lie I learned a ton while making this video because I really had to engage with some ideas that I was already familiar with and that is exactly what happened with Brilliant the sponsor of this video Brilliant is a website and app that teaches you all kinds of STEM concepts from geometry to quantum mechanics and you learn by doing They use interactivity to bring your understanding to the next level like calculus no problem It s way more fun when you work through the material yourself and get to manipulate it visually Check out these surfaces of revolution a clear demonstration of how you can use an integral to find volume The problems are carefully curated to increase in difficulty as you go and if you get stuck there is always a helpful hint If this video has whetted your appetite for complex numbers they have an awesome course on that subject from the Mandelbrot set to Eu\n",

            "In my last video I showed you five fun physics phenomena and asked you how they work You responded with thousands of comments and some video responses Well here are my explanations Let s start with a serial because it seems the simplest but it turns out to be one of the most surprising The simple explanation goes like this So I showed you cereal is magnetic I have ground up all of this cereal into a very fine powder Let us see what is in it I m going to take these strong magnets and run them over the cereal powder and see if anything is attracted to them Look how the cereal actually sticks to the magnet It s because there s pieces of iron in this cereal They ve been added because iron is something we need It s an essential nutrient that we need to survive In fact this cereal has 60 of your recommended daily intake of iron But there s more to it I received a video response from Martin air showing non magnetic objects like plastic and paper also apparently being attracted to a magnet So how does this work Well water is diamagnetic which means in the presence of a magnetic field it generates its own magnetic field in the opposite direction This means the water is very slightly repelled by the magnet and this causes a depression in the surface of the water into which a floating object will slide You can even see this depression by looking at the reflections off the water So cereal is attracted to a magnet due to its iron content but when floating on the surface of water there is an additional effect the depression of the water s surface due to its diamagnetism I showed you that you can find the center of mass of a cane or another stick type object just by moving your fingers in towards the middle from the outside But how does this work Even when you start in say an asymmetric position Well one finger is closer to the center of mass and therefore it carries more of the weight of the cane And so the friction force between your finger and the cane is greater until the point where the other finger catches up which point this finger slides in and eventually they must meet in the middle So this is a way you can find the center of mass of any cane or cane like object I showed you that if you try to flip your phone end over end there is no way to do it without it also rotating around the short axis as well Why is that The phone has three axes about which it can rotate There is the long axis which has the maximum moment of inertia meaning it requires the most torque to accelerate it in that direction Spinning about the short axis has the least moment of inertia then there is the intermediate axis which has a moment of inertia in between the other two Now the intermediate axis theorem says that if you try to flip any object along its intermediate axis it will not maintain simply that rotation It will also get rotations in any of the other directions That is if there is any slight deviation from a perfect rotat\n",

            "3. **Charged Cup and Water Stream**: Rubbing a cup on your hair to electrically charge it and then bringing it close to a stream of water can cause the water to deflect towards the cup. While commonly attributed to the polar nature of water molecules, the actual explanation involves the diamagnetic property of water creating a depression in its surface that attracts floating objects.\n",

            "How do bikes without riders stay upright As long as a bike is moving with sufficient speed it can keep coasting indefinitely But it turned out the ground where we went to test this effect was really bumpy But the bike still manages to absorb all these perturbations and remain stable So how does it do this I think most people believe it s the wheels spinning that creates some sort of gyroscopic effect that resists falling over Just like in this demonstration of gyroscopic precession the wheels stays upright even though gravity is pulling it down But this is not why bikes are stable Just watch what happens when we lock the handlebars completely so you can only go straight ahead The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they re cleverly designed to steer themselves If they start falling to one side the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them\n",

            "ike back under you The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they re cleverly designed to steer themselves themselves If they start falling to one side the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them At least three mechanisms are responsible for a bike s corrective steering The first is that due to the angle of the front fork the steering axis intersects the ground in front of where the wheel touches the ground So if the bike starts leaning to the left the force from the ground on the tire turns the wheel to the left If the bike starts leaning right the The force from the ground pushes the wheel to the right The front wheel of a bicycle is essentially a caster wheel like those you find on strollers or shopping carts Whichever way you drive them the wheel falls in line and rolls in the same direction The second reason for a bike s corrective steering is that the center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel are located slightly in front of the steering axis So when the bike leans left their weight pushes the front wheel to the left If the bike leans right their weight steers And the third mechanism is a gyroscopic effect but it doesn t keep the bike upright directly it just helps steer If you have a gyroscope and you push down on the left hand side the gyro will turn left If you push down on the right side it will turn right This is known as gyroscopic precession It seems as though the force you apply takes effect 90 degrees from where you applied it So bikes are stable primarily because of steering They have built in mechanisms for steering themselves In fact you don t need all three mechanisms to create a stable bike Researchers created this weird looking bicycle to prove a point It has no gyroscopic Thanks to counter rotating wheels above the wheels that touch the floor Plus there is no caster effect because the front wheel touches the floor in front of the steering axis But this bike is made stable by its mass distribution the force of gravity on which steers it in the direction of any lean Understanding how bicycles work is still an active area of research There is a program you can use to input all the different bicycle parameters and see the range of speed speeds over which it is self stable And this research is leading to better bikes This prototype has a smart motor in the handlebars to actively help steer keeping the bike upright even at low speeds I guess it s fitting that we are still learning new things about bicycles since most of us are able to ride one without any knowledge of how we re actually doing it of awesome hands on projects and toys designed to expose kids to STEAM concepts And with the holidays fast approaching a KiwiCo subscription is the perfect gift for any of the young people in your life KiwiCo now has nine different subscription lines for different age groups and topics Plus they ship to more than 40 countries I\n",

            "Bicycles are able to stay upright and stable due to three main mechanisms of corrective steering:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The front fork of the bike is designed in a way that the steering axis intersects the ground in front of where the wheel touches the ground. This causes the bike to steer itself back under the rider when it starts leaning to one side.\n",
            "   \n",
            "2. The center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel is positioned slightly in front of the steering axis. This means that when the bike leans to one side, the weight of the handlebars and front wheel naturally steers the bike back upright.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Gyroscopic effects play a role in helping steer the bike. When force is applied to one side of the bike, the gyroscopic effect causes the bike to turn in the opposite direction, assisting in maintaining stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "These mechanisms work together to keep a bike upright and stable, even without a rider actively steering it. The design of bicycles is a fascinating interplay of physics and engineering, and ongoing research continues to improve bike designs for better stability and performance.\n",
